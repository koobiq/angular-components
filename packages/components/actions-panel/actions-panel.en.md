`ActionsPanel` - popup panel with bulk actions on selected objects.

<!-- example(actions-panel-overview) -->

### Properties

#### Adaptability

The bulk actions panel becomes compact to fit in the available screen area.

<!-- example(actions-panel-adaptive) -->

#### Additional counter

The component has an option to show an additional counter. The principle of operation of the additional counter can be customized to meet the needs of your product. For example, if the list items are grouped, the counter inside the badge can show the total number of items, not just groups.

<!-- example(actions-panel-custom-counter) -->

### Keyboard interaction

By default, the `ESCAPE` key closes `KbqActionsPanel`. While you can disable this behavior via the `disableClose` property of `KbqActionsPanelConfig`.
