### Decimal separator

In Russian, a comma is used as the separator in decimal fractions, not a dot.

### Numbers are grouped by digit groups

In large numbers, digit groups are separated by a thin space — they are grouped in threes, counting from the right: in text — starting from 5 digits: 1234, 56 789, 987 654, 1 000 000 000. In tables — always: 1 234, 56 789, 987 654, 1 000 000 000.
