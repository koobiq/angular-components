### Horizontal

<!-- example(horizontal-form) -->

#### Label column width

By default, labels occupy one out of four columns with a 16 px gutter.<br/>
You can also set a different size, including a fixed width.

<!-- example(horizontal-form-labels) -->

### Vertical layout

<!-- example(vertical-form) -->

### Grouped fields

Multiple fields can be combined and grouped together to emphasize their relationship.

<!-- example(form-fieldset-overview) -->

Within a group, you can use a placeholder as the field label. Hints and errors will be shown below the group in sequence, with an indication of the specific field they relate to. You can also use a general message for the group or omit the field names in the text if the meaning remains clear without labels.

<!-- example(form-fieldset-invalid) -->

A button can also be combined with a field.

<!-- example(form-fieldset-with-button) -->
