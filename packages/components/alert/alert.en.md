Shows important information on a page. Can contain a hint, signal a status change, or indicate a problem.

### Size

<!-- example(alert-size) -->

### Variant

By default, alerts are styled conservatively and stand out only by the icon color. If the block gets lost on screen, you can draw attention to it using the colored background variant.

<!-- example(alert-variants) -->

### Status

<!-- example(alert-status) -->

### Hide

The block can be hidden by clicking the icon button in the corner of the alert. If the system reports a problem, the alert is displayed permanently and the user cannot close it.

<!-- example(alert-close) -->

### Content

The alert can contain links and buttons; the icon and heading can be omitted. In a lengthy notification, the text can be split into paragraphs.

<!-- example(alert-content) -->
