`KbqContentPanel` - a slide-out side panel that shifts adjacent content. Often used to implement a quick preview mode for entities from a table.

<!-- example(content-panel-overview) -->

### Keyboard interaction

By default, the `ESCAPE` key closes the panel, but you can disable this behavior using the `disableClose` attribute:

```html
<kbq-content-panel-container disableClose>...</kbq-content-panel-container>
```
