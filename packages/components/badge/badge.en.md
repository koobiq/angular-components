### Recommendations

- Badges can be used on their own, while [tags](/en/components/tag) are more often part of other controls: [Select](/en/components/select/overview#multiple-selection), [Tag autocomplete](/en/components/tag-autocomplete/), [Tag input](/en/components/tag-input/).
- Don't overuse badges: the screen quickly turns into a colorful garland and emphasis is lost.
- A list of tags can draw excessive attention. Elements can be displayed separated by commas, interpuncts, or small indentation.
