### Multiple platforms

When the system has multiple platforms, the applications of the selected platform are shown at the top of the list and the platform name is displayed. Other platforms are collapsed at the bottom of the list. 4 or more applications of the same type within a platform are grouped together. The main platform is marked with a badge.

Search appears when more than 7 applications are available. Results are displayed as a flat list.
