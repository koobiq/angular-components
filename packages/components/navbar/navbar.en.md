The main menu allows for product navigation. It consists of a logo and section links. You can also add an application switch, main action button, notification center, and search.

You can place the menu at the top or to the left. Both options have their advantages. Select the one that suits your product better.

### Horizontal menu

The menu uses the top row and allows content to occupy the full screen width. The horizontal menu works better with three or more columns. The main menu is pinned to the top and remains visible when you scroll content.

<!-- example(navbar-overview) -->

### Vertical menu

The vertical menu is convenient for long pages. When unfolded, it takes more place on a screen. When collapsed, it shows sections as icons. In some cases, it may be a challenge to pick a clear visual representation for a section.

<!-- example(navbar-vertical) -->

### Unfolded menu that overlays content

You can also make the vertical menu overlay page content.

<!-- example(navbar-vertical-open-over) -->
