Component for automatically hiding elements with dynamic adaptation to the container width.

Supports two modes of operation:

- hiding from the end (default)
- hiding from the start

Configurable via the `reverseOverflowOrder` attribute.

### Order of Hiding

The order in which elements are hidden is determined using the `order` attribute for the `KbqOverflowItem` directive.
