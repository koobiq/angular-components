### Editing

To enable editing mode, you need to set the `editable` property for `kbq-tag-list` or individual `kbq-tag`.

Enter editing mode:

- On double click on the tag.
- On pressing `Enter` or `F2` key (when tag is focused).

Save changes:

- On pressing `Enter` key.
- On clicking the confirmation button (`kbqTagEditSubmit` directive).

Cancel changes:

- On pressing `Escape` key.
- On focus loss.

In editing mode, the tag transforms into an input field and remains at the same position within the control.
