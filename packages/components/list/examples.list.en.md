#### Multiple selection with mixed state

In the privilege assignment interface, clicking the "Assign" button opens a window where you can specify which users should receive a specific privilege. A list item with a checkbox in the indeterminate state indicates that the privilege is assigned to only some users. Activating this list item will assign the privilege to all selected users.
