### Recommendations

- By default, it is recommended to use up to 7 options in a Radio Group.
- Use [Button Toggle](/en/components/button-toggle) for short options when there is sufficient horizontal space.
- If more than 7 options need to be displayed, it is better to use [Select](/en/components/select).
- If the selection involves two values and can be classified as boolean, use [Toggle](/en/components/toggle). Toggle applies changes instantly, without additional data saving.
