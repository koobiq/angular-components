A table is similar to a grid but simpler in structure. Users cannot sort columns or change their widths. Only standard HTML table capabilities are available.

By default, text in cells wraps to a new line:

### Borders

In most cases, borders should be avoided, but sometimes they help support the layout when a table has gaps due to cell content varying between long and short text.

Borders are also useful in tables with complex structures — for example, when rows are grouped or some cells are merged vertically.
