A placeholder component for empty states or error messages. The border is not part of the component; it is shown only for illustration purposes.

<!-- example(empty-state-default) -->

### Size

For full-screen placeholders, a block with larger-sized elements can be used.

<!-- example(empty-state-big) -->

### Size - variations

The component size is set using the `size` attribute.

<!-- example(empty-state-size) -->

### Align

Content can be aligned to the center or to the top.

<!-- example(empty-state-align) -->

### Error

The Empty State component can be used to display an error message. In this state, the text turns red.

<!-- example(empty-state-error) -->

### Content

#### Illustration

The illustration size can be changed. A large illustration is suitable for full-screen placeholders. If a placeholder is needed for just a specific block, the illustration can be made compact or omitted entirely.

<!-- example(empty-state-content) -->

In a center-aligned component with an illustration, an additional bottom offset is added, which raises the composition to provide optical compensation.

#### Icon

An icon can be used as the illustration.

<!-- example(empty-state-icon) -->

#### Title

<!-- example(empty-state-title) -->

#### Actions

One or more actions can be placed below the text: buttons, links, and pseudo-links.

<!-- example(empty-state-actions) -->

<!-- example(empty-state-actions2) -->

#### Text only

<!-- example(empty-state-text-only) -->
