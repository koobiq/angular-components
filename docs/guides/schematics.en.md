### How to run a schematic

-   Make sure Angular CLI is installed:

```bash
ng version
```

-   Run the desired schematic using the `ng generate` command:

```bash
ng generate @koobiq/components:<schematic-name>
```

-   Some schematics support additional options. See the `schema.json` file inside the corresponding schematic folder.
